# TypeScript definitions of MediaWiki front end code interfaces

NOTE: This exists as a separate repository for the time being. It has been created with idea in mind that it those definitions could be maintained together with MediaWiki front end code itself.

## Development

We recommend using Docker (e.g. via [fresh](https://github.com/wikimedia/fresh)) as a development environment.
